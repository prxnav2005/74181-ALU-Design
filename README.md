# 74181-ALU-Design

## Description
The 74181 is said to be the first ALU design introduced as a standalone integraded circuit by Texas Instruments in the year 1966.


It is designed for performing various arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and complement, all controlled via a set of input signals that define the desired operation. With the ability to handle 4-bit binary numbers and offering features like carry-in and carry-out for multi-bit operations, the 74181 is particularly useful in applications requiring efficient data manipulation and processing.

## Functionality

It provides all 16 Boolean logic functions, as well as addition to these functions. The circuitry is designed around carry lookahead, generating G and P signals, so the result can be produced in parallel without waiting for carry propagation. Modern processors continue to use carry lookahead, but in more complex forms optimized for long words and efficient chip layout.
